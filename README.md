 RAG-Based Detailed Text Summarizer

A simple, fast, and effective **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** summarizer for long text, articles, or scripts. This project uses **FAISS** for semantic chunk retrieval and a **transformer-based summarizer** to generate **structured summaries** that retain all key concepts, technical points, and important data.

 Features

*  Accepts long raw text (no PDFs needed)
*  Splits text into overlapping chunks for semantic indexing
*  Uses FAISS for efficient similarity search
*  RAG-based pipeline powered by `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and `distilBART`
* Generates structured, detailed summaries with high factual retention
* Clean Gradio UI for easy interaction

 Demo

üëâ Upload long text ‚Üí Click "Index Text" ‚Üí Ask: ‚ÄúSummarize key concepts‚Äù

 Tech Stack

* `sentence-transformers` ‚Äì For embedding the text chunks
* `faiss-cpu` ‚Äì For fast vector-based chunk retrieval
* `transformers` ‚Äì HuggingFace summarization model
* `gradio` ‚Äì Easy-to-use web interface




 Example Use

**Input:** A 5000-word research article
**Query:** *"Summarize the key findings and methodology"*
**Output:** A multi-paragraph summary with:

* Bullet points for major concepts
* Descriptions of datasets, models, and metrics
* Final results and conclusion


 To-Do / Future Improvements

* [ ] Export summary as PDF or `.txt`
* [ ] Switch to Long-T5 or GPT-4 via API
* [ ] Add support for live URL/article scraping
